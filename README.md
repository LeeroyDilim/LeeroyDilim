## Hello there!

My name is Leeroy Dilim, I am a fourth year computer science co-op student at the University of Manitoba. I am passionate in using my skills to help people and one way I do that is volunteer as a mentor at tech events, where I help teach young students or underrepresented people to be introduced in tech. Another way is that I like to make applications that are tailored to their users, focusing on creating features that make it easier for users to achieve their goals. A prominent goal in my projects is that I want to make it easier for people to do their jobs efficiently and live their life without frustrations.

## Current Projects:

[431Transit](https://github.com/LeeroyDilim/431Transit)
  * A transit mobile app built for android that provides real time bus stop and schedule information around the Winnipeg area.
  * Integrates Google Maps Static Maps and Winnipeg Transit API for real-time information
  * Built using Android Studio and Java
    
[COMP 4350: Software Engineering 2 Group Project](https://github.com/rainclouded/Concierge)
  * A hotel management software with the vision of bringing the hotel industry up to modern standards, ditching landline phones and instead using a website for users to request hotel services and inquire     information. It also features a staff dashboard where staff can process user tasks, manage incident reports, and do other hotel management operations.
  * This software features a microservice architecture, using .NET/C#, and Python/Flask to implement it's microservices. MongoDB and SQL will be used for our data layer.
  * Two front-ends will be created for this project. One built using React.js that is dedicated for guests, and another built using Angular that is dedicated for staff.
